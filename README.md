# Divide a dataset using the Pandas library 

This code assumes that the dataset is stored in a file called "dataset.csv". You would need to replace "column_name" and "some_value" with the appropriate column name and value used to divide the dataset. The code also includes comments for optional steps 2 and 6. Uncomment these lines if you need to clean the data or store the divided datasets.
